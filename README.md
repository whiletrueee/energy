## 🚀 Electricity Usage Cost Prediction Project 🚀

### Overview
This Python project aims to predict monthly electricity usage costs based on a diverse dataset encompassing energy use data, outdoor environmental data, indoor environmental data, HVAC operational data, and occupant data. The data spans multiple time frames from September 2018 to December 2020.

### 📊 Data Integration
- Load data from separate CSV files for each data source.
- Combine the data into a unified dataset using a common timestamp or date.

### ⏰ Date Range Intersection
- Identify common dates among different date ranges provided.

### 🛠️ Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values, outliers, and any data quality issues.
- Resample the data to a monthly frequency.

### 🧐 Feature Selection
- Select relevant features based on their relevance to electricity usage cost prediction.

### 🤖 Model Selection
- Choose a suitable time series forecasting model. Consider machine learning models if needed.

### 📚 Training and Testing
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Train the model on historical data.

### 📈 Model Evaluation
- Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Mean Squared Error (MSE) on the testing set.

### 🚀 Prediction
- Use the trained model to predict electricity usage cost for future months.

### 📊 Visualization
- Visualize the actual vs. predicted values to assess the accuracy of the model.
